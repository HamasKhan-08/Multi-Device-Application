        Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by <a href="https://www.infinityward.com/" target="_blank"> Infinity Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.ravensoftware.com/" target="_blank"> Raven Software</a> for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. <br> <br>
        It is a sequel to 2020's Call of Duty: Warzone. The game is a part of 2022's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II but does not require purchase of the parent title. It was introduced during Season 1 of Modern Warfare II content. The game features cross-platform play and a new extraction mode titled DMZ.</p>

    <p>  <!--Text / Paragraph-->
         Similar to its predecessor, in Warzone 2.0's primary game mode, Battle Royale, players compete in a continuously shrinking map to be the last player(s) remaining. Players parachute onto a large game map, where they encounter and eliminate other players. <br> <br>
         As the game progresses and players are eliminated, the playable area shrinks, forcing the remaining players into tighter spaces. A new feature in Warzone 2.0, Circle Collapse, allows multiple circles to spawn within the map, which close independently of one another, before converging into one single safe zone. <br> <br>
         Like the first Warzone, upon death, players are sent to the "Gulag", a small-sized arena where killed players battle one another for a chance at respawning into the map. In Warzone 2.0, Gulag matches were initially introduced in 2v2 format, and included an AI combatant called "the Jailer", whom players can hunt down to acquire a key and escape, in addition to the traditional method of winning Gulag matches. </p>

        "By their very competitive, dog-eat-dog nature, battle royale games don’t tend to be about making friends with the people you meet. But with its big 2.0 revamp, Call of Duty: Warzone has made some admirable efforts toward inspiring us to work together, communicate, and socialize even as we fight to be the last ones standing." <br> <br>
        "Our new battleground, Al Mazrah, is an interesting map to explore thanks to its many cities full of buildings to loot from and 18 points of interest, from a literal fortress to airports and even a mining city." <br> <br>
        "Building on the already rock-solid foundation of the original Warzone, Warzone 2.0 is a positive update to Call of Duty’s battle royale mode, even with few drawbacks of its own. Its new map isn’t the most exciting outside of being the biggest ever brought to Warzone, but great additions like proximity chat and an updated ping system change things up and bring new life to the struggle for survival. " </p>

            [Warzone 2.0] is mixed, with some of its new additions making the moment-to-moment action feel fresh, while updates to other classic Warzone features feel like a step back for the battle royale title. <br> <br> 
            "Warzone 2 comes out swinging with the strongest map yet, as Al Mazrah's design is both visually appealing and well-balanced to encourage more moment-to-moment action and player movement. " <br> <br>
            "Packaged with DMZ, which feels like a sandbox hit, free-to-play Call of Duty players have so many more ways to jump into the action and level up this year."</p>
