         "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the most fun I’ve had in CoD multiplayer in a good long while. It’s taken what was already a mechanically solid multiplayer game and improved on it with a weapon customization system that's almost limitless in its possibilities, and its new focus on bigger maps with tons of players has paid off bigtime." <br> <br>
         "That’s on top of the usual load of modes, and they all let the excellent, weighty gunplay shine. That said, performance issues on PC and even some across consoles put a damper on the fun, and at launch there are a lot more issues than I would have expected – including temporarily turning off that awesome weapon customization." <br> <br>
         "But aside from those hiccups it’s been great, and the constant stream of unlocks are a really effective carrot on a stick that keep me interested moving forward." </p>

        "Infinity Ward's rebooted Modern Warfare 2 brings back a more classic Call of Duty multiplayer experience than we've seen in recent years, with maps better tailored to traditional 6v6 play and dialed-back movement mechanics." <br> <br> 
        "Modern Warfare 2's gameplay really feels like a refreshing return to old times again for Call of Duty, but unfortunately, the package as a whole feels lacking and gun customization is overly complex." <br> <br> 
        "Infinity Ward definitely improved a lot on what worked and didn't work in the previous game. The scaled-back maps definitely make for better pacing, the less hectic movement is not so overwhelming, and all the new maneuverability features make the game so enjoyable from match to match."</p>
